Elevator Pitch:


That feeling when you’re sure you’ve watched every movie or tv series on the world wide web. But there is no way Hollywood would leave you stranded like that! Let FlixList scour all your favorite streaming services, and then some, based on YOUR entertainment personality. We will guide you towards the entertainment selections that you’ve been missing out on. FlixList will take into account your entertainment viewing ‘personality’ and tailor your viewing bucket so that it’s never empty. How will we do this? Members will fill out an entertainment ‘personality’ questionnaire that includes genres you vibe with, release  date range preferences, and so on. Besides this tailored entertainment bucket of what to watch next, you can add other must-watch movies and TV series content, for an even better understanding of what’s left to watch. It’s that easy! So stop the endless surfing! Flixlist makes it so you don’t have to waste time, while wasting time.
